    I am a second-year Ph.D. student, supervised by Prof.
    <a href="https://history.siggraph.org/person/dr-david-kei-man-yip/" target="_blank">David Yip</a>.

  <p>
    My research focuses on Human-Centered Computing, aiming to understand and model how technology shapes human behavior and societal dynamics. I am particularly interested in interactive AI for digital cultural heritage, including AIGC-enabled experiences for heritage interpretation, storytelling, and preservation.
