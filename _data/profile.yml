  <p>
I am a second-year Ph.D. student, supervised by [David Yip](https://www.daveyip.com).
    <p>
 My research focuses on Human-Centered Computing, aiming to understand and model how technology shapes human behavior and societal dynamics. I am particularly interested in interactive AI for digital cultural heritage, including AIGC-enabled experiences for heritage interpretation, storytelling, and preservation.
